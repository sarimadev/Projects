**Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**
Introduction
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an advanced machine learning discipline aimed at identifying and categorizing emotions embedded in spoken language. This project focuses on developing a robust and reliable SER pipeline to accurately recognize and classify emotions from speech data, leveraging supervised learning techniques.

Objective
The primary goal is to build a model that demonstrates superior performance in emotion recognition from speech, compared to established baselines. This capability has significant implications in areas such as mental health monitoring, customer service, human-computer interaction, and e-learning systems.

Installation
Required Python libraries for this project include:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib imblearn scikit-learn tensorflow keras librosa xgboost catboost
Data
The project utilizes various datasets to train and evaluate the models, focusing on diverse emotional states conveyed in speech.

Models and Methodology
Several machine learning models, including SVM, KNN, XGBoost, CatBoost, and others, are trained and evaluated. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and feature extraction
Model training with hyperparameter tuning
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC
Results and Discussion
The results showcase the effectiveness of the models in accurately classifying emotional states from speech data. Key findings and insights from the project are discussed, along with visualizations to illustrate model performance.

Usage
The project is structured in Jupyter Notebooks:

model_prep.ipynb for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
Model_train.ipynb for model training and evaluation.
Run these notebooks sequentially in Jupyter to replicate the project's workflow.
